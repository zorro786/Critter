# Critter

Critter@home is a project to connect researchers to content-rich data from anonymous Internet end-users. Our goal is to facilitate the safe sharing of data and provide a platform for end-users to contribute data and be part of the research process.

Based on the paper:
V. Sharma, G. Bartlett and J. Mirkovic, "Critter: Content-Rich Traffic Trace Repository", Workshop on Information Sharing and Collaborative Security (WISCS), http://www.isi.edu/~bartlett/pubs/wiscs14-critter.pdf 2014.
